## Background Information

The gods are matched in opposition to each other for battle

>*τῶν θεῶν μαχη περίεχει φυσικὴν στοιχείων προ στοιχεῖα ἀντίταξιν κακιῶν πρὸς ἀρετάς*
>
> The battle of the gods encompasses the natural opposition of elements against elements, vices against .

---

## First Observation

> Ἥρα δὲ (ἐναντιοῦται) Ἀρτέμιδι ὁ περίγειος αηρ τῇ σελήνη˙
>
> Hera is in opposition to Artemis (as) the air surrounding the earth is to the moon.

---

## Resulting Questions

- Why is Hera the air and Artemis the moon?

- Why are the moon and the air opposed to each other?

>Ἥρα δέ ἐστιν ἀήρ˙ Ἄρτεμις δὲ σελήνη ἀερότεμίς τις οῦσα ἡ τὸν ἀέρα τέμνουσα ἐξ οῦ ἤρτηται.*
>
> Hera is air. Artemis is the moon, being some "aer-temis" who, cutting the air, does not hang from it.

- Redundancy to the original scholion suggests intertextual links

### Questions Refined

- Can we find intertextual depth to the allegorical explanation?

- What is the origin of the etymology *ἀερότεμίς*?

---
Porphyry the Grammarian

- *Ἀερότεμίς* is a rare word characteristically found in the work of Porphyry, a Neoplatonist grammarian from 3rd century A.D.

- His work is published in a *Homeric Problemata*, a genre defending Homer against criticism

- Porphyry's work contains etymological and allegorical information
that has shaped scholarly tradition

---
Porphyry in Eusebius' *Praeperatio Evangelica*

- Eusebius was a church father. Porphyry wrote about pagan deities

>Καὶ τοῦ μὲν παντὸς ἀέρος ἡ δύναμις Ἥρα τοὔνομα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀέρος κεκλη-
μένη·

>'And the power of all air is Hera, called by a name derived from the air.'

>τὴν δὲ σελήνην παρὰ τὸ σέλας ὑπολαβόντες Ἄρτεμιν προσηγόρευσαν, οἷον ἀερότεμιν

>'And having taken up the moon according to its brightness, they called it Artemis, such as 'ἀερότεμιν' (cutting the air).'

### Porphyry in the Venetus A and B

- Porphyry not only appears in Venetus A (urn:cite2:hmt:pers:pers77), but his work seems linked to Venetus B

> *τὴν δ' αὖ σελήνην Ἄρτεμιν, τὸν ἀέρα δὲ Ἥραν*: ¨The moon Artemis, the air Hera"

### Before Porphyry: Heraclitus

- Venetus B has a high concentration of Heraclitean material

-  Heraclitus the grammarian (1st century A.D.) was a proponent of the allegorical tradition

-  Only extant work is a *Homeric Problemata*

- Searched his *Homeric Problemata* for etymological and allegorical issues

- Manuscripts represented in the result: two in the Vatican Library, one in the British Royal Library

---
### Tracing the Etymology: Heraclitus (cont.)

*Οὐδὲ τοῦτ' ἀλόγος εἰσήγαγεν Ὅμερος˙ ἀλλ' ὥσπερ ἔφην Ἥρα μέν έστιν ἀήρ, τὴν δὲ σελήνην Ἄρτεμιν ὀνομάζει˙ πᾶν δὲ τὸ τεμνόμενον ἀεὶ πολέμίον ἐστι τῷ τέμνοντι˙ διὰ τοῦτο ἐχθρὰν ἀέρι τὴν σελήνην ὑπεστήσατο τὴν ἐν ἀέρι ἀυτῆς φορὰν καὶ τοὺς δρόμους ὑποσημαίνων.*

"Homer has not introduced these details either without good reason. As I have said, Hera is air, and he calls the moon Artemis. Now whatever is cut [*τεμνομενον*] is always the enemy of the cutter [*τεμνον*], and this is why he has made the moon the enemy of the air [*αηρ*] suggesting thereby the movement and course of the moon through the air."

---
### Conclusions

- Now we know why the air and the moon are opposed!

- Scholia tradition provides a valuable insight into ancient philology and thought

---
### Next Steps

- Look at the characterizations of the other gods in their respective battles

- Look at the allegorical and etymological elements of the explanations

- Look at other manuscripts in the Homer Multitext project that would allow for greater breadth and depth in studying allegorical and etymological traditions
